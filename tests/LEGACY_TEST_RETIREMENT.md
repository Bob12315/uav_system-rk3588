# Phase 2 legacy test retirement

These tests were removed from the active suite because they imported deleted
mission/stage/control packages during collection. The production stack was not restored.

| Retired test | Missing legacy dependency | Remaining value and disposition | Current/future coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `test_app_config.py` | StageRegistry and visual/rescue configs | Current Web UI, telemetry parser and removed CLI assertions migrated; old mission config assertions retired | `test_action_lab_only_startup.py` |
| `test_approach_track.py` | `missions.visual_tracking.stages` and `missions.common.control` | Bound entirely to removed controller | No current replacement; do not restore old stage |
| `test_command_shaper.py` | `missions.common.control` | Limit/slew/NaN safety remains valuable but the old shaper is not the Action path | Future Action-compatible safety pipeline tests after architecture decision |
| `test_debug_runtime.py` | `missions.base` and old debug config | Tested legacy forced stage mode | Action Lab/Mission lifecycle tests replace the active use case |
| `test_downward_align_descend.py` | rescue stage and old control types | Camera alignment/descent behavior remains valuable | `test_align_descend_action.py` and dispatcher tests |
| `test_executor.py` | old FlightCommandExecutor/types | Gimbal conversion assertion was tied to inactive executor | Future dispatcher/LinkManager contract tests if required |
| `test_input_adapter.py` | old StageInputAdapter | Stage filtering/stability behavior is not in current Action path | Current runtime context/action tests; add an Action-specific adapter only if designed |
| `test_mission_navigation.py` | removed `missions.common.navigation` | Transform and tolerance math remains useful, but its frame convention is legacy | `test_runtime_context.py`; future CoordinateTransform/FieldReference tests |
| `test_mission_registry.py` | `missions.registry`, visual/rescue missions | Registry and switching behavior replaced by Action registry/templates | `test_action_lab_registry.py`, `test_action_mission_templates.py`, orchestrator tests |
| `test_mission_runner.py` | MissionRunner, MissionAction and old control context | Dispatch/once/dry-run behavior remains important | `test_action_lab_dispatch.py`, `test_action_runtime.py`, orchestrator tests |
| `test_overhead_hold.py` | visual tracking stage and old control types | Bound entirely to removed controller | No current replacement; do not restore old stage |
| `test_visual_tracking_mission.py` | old mission/control packages | Bound entirely to removed mission state machine | Action Mission template/orchestrator scenario tests |

The active suite must not add import ignores or recreate the deleted packages merely to
make these tests collect. Known mainline assertion failures are tracked separately from
these collection failures.
